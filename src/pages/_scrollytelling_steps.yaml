  description: Using the Food Retail Store data, light blue dots represent stores that self categorize as "delis, mart's, or Convennience stores", while dark blue dots are the rest of the retail food options including bigger grocery stores like Whole Foods. It is interesting to see how the "bodegas" are more prevelant in the neighborhoods with lower property value, and the inverse is true as well, higher property areas contain fewer bodegas.
